								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I am a Junior at Hunter College in NYC, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My internship, project, and extracurricular experiences have given me a set of great technical skills and soft skills. My passion for technolgy stems from working in a team to come up with innovative solutions, and I have further learned this about myself through these experiences.</p>

								<h2>Experience</h2>
							</header>
							<p>As a Software Developer and UX designer for CultureLancer, a startup I was paired with as a part of the Blackstone LaunchPad internship program, I have gotten valuable experience in back-end work, along with Microsoft Azure databases and design fundamentals with Figma. Additionally, as a Software Engineering intern for Art Beyond Sight in the summer of 2023, I got valuable experience with front-end work using HTML/CSS with a goal of making the organization's website disability inclusive.</p>
							<p>Serving as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the Hunter College Computer Science Department, a large part of my job includes teamwork with other UTAs and patience, while crafting simple yet informative answers for students struggling in any Python or C++ concepts. I am also involved in organizations such as BASTA, the Hunter CS Club, Headstarter AI, CodePath, and I serve as a Student Ambassodor for Propel2Excel. </p>
							<p>I have some key certifications that highlight my desire to pursue my passion for technolgy and learn more outside the classroom. Highlighted from these is Google's cybersecurity course, a Generative AI training I had the opportunity to participate in as an Accenture extern, and CodePath's web development course. Some recognition I have recieved are being a part of the Thomas Hunter Honor's program at my school, being on the Hunter Dean List all of my semesters in school, and an award from BASTA for demonstrating leadership and teamwork in a cohort of 50+ fellows.</p>
